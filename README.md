The project is a compilation of analytics done for potato chips retail. It consists of two parts: 

<b>Part1 - Customer Purchase Behavior Analytics</b>
The customers data set and the transaction data set was combined together to analyze and identify common patterns for potato chips sale. Based on the product preference findings, it was suggested to increase product visibility to customer segments by placing the products in their preferred section of the retail. That is the retail section where the consumer segments frequent the most. 

<b>Part 2 - Store Trial Layout Analysis</b>
Based on the recommendations of customer purchase behavior analysis, 3 stores were chosen for layout re-design. The layouts were trialed for 3 months. The analysis was to identify if the trial layouts were successfull in increasing customers footfalls at the store and sales for potato chip products.
